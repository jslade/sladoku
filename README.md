Motivation
==========

**sladoku** is a collection of sudoku-related projects, with two primary goals:

* Building a portfolio of representative code in various languages, so I can readily share my own original work with prospective clients / employers.
* Solving a known problem in various languages and programming paradigms -- to learn and practice new things.

I chose sudoku because it's not completely trivial, but also not terribly complicated -- the code to implement a solver in any given language is relatively small. It's familiar to those who might want to evaluate my work, so the quality of the code can be judged without needing specialized domain knowledge. And there are interesting options for front-end and back-end development.


Target platforms
================

So far I've implemented the following:
